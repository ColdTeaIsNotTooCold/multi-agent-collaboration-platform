# Task: Database Schema and Setup (MVP)

## Description
Design and implement the database schema for MVP functionality, including migrations, basic queries, and Redis caching setup. Focus on essential data models for agents, tasks, users, and basic audit trails.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Database schema design for agents, tasks, users, and audit logs
- [ ] Database migration scripts for setup and updates
- [ ] PostgreSQL database configuration and optimization
- [ ] Redis configuration for sessions and caching
- [ ] Basic database seeding for initial data
- [ ] Connection pooling and configuration
- [ ] Basic data validation at database level
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures documented
- [ ] Performance optimization for common queries
- [ ] Integration tests for database operations

## Technical Details
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 14+ with proper indexing
- **ORM**: Sequelize or Prisma for Node.js integration
- **Caching**: Redis for session management and frequent queries
- **Migrations**: Database migration system for schema changes
- **Backup**: pg_dump for basic backups

**Core Tables:**
- **users**: id, email, password_hash, role, created_at, updated_at
- **agents**: id, name, type, capabilities, status, created_at, updated_at
- **tasks**: id, title, description, status, assigned_agent, created_by, created_at, updated_at
- **task_messages**: id, task_id, sender_type, message, created_at
- **audit_logs**: id, action, user_id, details, created_at

## Dependencies
- [ ] PostgreSQL server setup and access
- [ ] Redis server setup and access
- [ ] Database connection credentials
- [ ] Backend development environment

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S (Small)
- Hours: 40 hours (1 week for 1 developer)
- Parallel: true (can work in parallel with backend)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Database schema designed and implemented
- [ ] Migration scripts working correctly
- [ ] Database seeded with test data
- [ ] Redis caching configured and tested
- [ ] Performance tests for common queries
- [ ] Backup procedures documented and tested
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Database optimization complete
- [ ] Documentation for schema and setup
