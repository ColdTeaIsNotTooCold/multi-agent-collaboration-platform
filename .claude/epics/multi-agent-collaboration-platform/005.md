# Task: Deployment and Documentation (MVP)

## Description
Set up deployment infrastructure using Docker Compose, create basic documentation, and prepare the MVP for testing and demonstration. Focus on simple, reliable deployment without complex orchestration.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Docker Compose setup for local development
- [ ] Production deployment configuration
- [ ] Basic deployment scripts and procedures

- [ ] Basic monitoring and logging setup
- [ ] User documentation and getting started guide
- [ ] Developer documentation and API reference
- [ ] Deployment testing and validation
- [ ] Basic backup and recovery procedures
- [ ] Performance and security baseline testing

## Technical Details
- **Containerization**: Docker and Docker Compose
- **Deployment**: Simple cloud server deployment
- **Environment**: Environment variables and configuration files
- **Monitoring**: Basic logging and health checks
- **Documentation**: Markdown-based with clear instructions
- **Testing**: End-to-end testing of deployed application
