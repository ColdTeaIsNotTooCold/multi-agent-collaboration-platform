# Task: Core Backend and APIs (MVP)

## Description
Build the core monolithic backend application with essential APIs for agent management, task orchestration, and basic communication. This focuses on the fundamental functionality needed for the MVP version.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Agent registration and management APIs (create, update, delete, list agents)
- [ ] Basic task orchestration engine with manual assignment
- [ ] Task status tracking and progress monitoring
- [ ] REST API endpoints for all core functionality
- [ ] WebSocket connection for real-time updates
- [ ] Basic authentication and authorization (JWT)
- [ ] Agent capability declaration and discovery
- [ ] Simple agent-to-agent messaging system
- [ ] Health check endpoints and basic logging
- [ ] Unit tests for core business logic

## Technical Details
- **Framework**: Node.js + Express.js (monolithic application)
- **Architecture**: Single application with modular structure
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with bcrypt password hashing
- **Real-time**: Socket.io for WebSocket connections
- **Validation**: Input validation and sanitization
- **Error Handling**: Proper error responses and logging
- **Testing**: Jest for unit tests, Supertest for API tests

**Key API Endpoints:**
- POST /api/agents - Register new agent
- GET /api/agents - List all agents
- POST /api/tasks - Create new task
- GET /api/tasks/:id - Get task details
- PUT /api/tasks/:id/assign - Assign task to agent
- POST /api/auth/login - User authentication

## Dependencies
- [ ] Node.js development environment
- [ ] Database connection (PostgreSQL)
- [ ] Basic development tools and testing framework

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M (Medium)
- Hours: 64 hours (2 weeks for 1 developer)
- Parallel: true (can start immediately)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All core APIs implemented and tested
- [ ] Real-time WebSocket functionality working
- [ ] Authentication system functional
- [ ] Basic agent management working
- [ ] Task assignment and tracking operational
- [ ] Unit tests passing with >70% coverage
- [ ] API documentation complete
- [ ] Basic error handling and logging in place
