# Task: AI Integration (MVP)

## Description
Integrate OpenAI GPT-4 API to enable AI agent functionality. Focus on core AI capabilities for task processing, agent communication, and basic decision making without complex multi-provider support.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] OpenAI GPT-4 API integration with proper error handling
- [ ] Basic agent communication using AI models
- [ ] Task processing and analysis capabilities
- [ ] Simple prompt template system
- [ ] API usage tracking and cost monitoring
- [ ] Fallback mechanisms for API failures
- [ ] Rate limiting and quota management
- [ ] Basic response validation and safety checks
- [ ] Performance optimization for AI responses
- [ ] Integration tests for AI functionality

## Technical Details
- **AI Provider**: OpenAI GPT-4 API (primary focus)
- **Integration**: REST API calls with proper error handling
- **Prompt Engineering**: Basic template system with variables
- **Caching**: Response caching to reduce API costs
- **Monitoring**: Usage tracking and cost estimation
