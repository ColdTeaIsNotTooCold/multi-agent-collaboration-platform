# Epic: Multi-Agent Collaboration Platform (MVP)

## Overview

This epic implements a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** version of the multi-agent collaboration platform. The MVP focuses on core functionality: enabling multiple AI agents to coordinate on tasks with a simple web interface, basic task orchestration, and human oversight. The goal is to validate the core value proposition quickly with minimal complexity.

## MVP Scope (What's In)

### Core Features
- **Basic Agent Management**: Simple agent registration, status tracking, and capability declaration
- **Simple Task Orchestration**: Manual task assignment to agents with basic progress tracking
- **Agent Communication**: REST API + WebSocket for real-time agent coordination
- **Web Dashboard**: Basic interface for monitoring agents and tasks
- **Human Oversight**: Simple approval workflow for critical agent decisions
- **Single AI Integration**: Focus on one LLM provider (OpenAI GPT-4)

### Technical Approach (Simplified)
- **Monolithic Architecture**: Single Node.js/Express application (not microservices)
- **Simple Deployment**: Docker Compose for local development and staging
- **Basic Database**: PostgreSQL for data storage, Redis for caching
- **Minimal Monitoring**: Basic logging and health checks
- **Simple Auth**: JWT-based authentication with basic roles

### Non-Goals (What's Out for MVP)
- Kubernetes orchestration
- Microservices architecture
- Enterprise-scale monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana/ELK)
- Advanced workflow builder
- Multi-tenancy
- Advanced analytics
- Multiple AI provider integrations
- Complex security/compliance features

## Architecture Decisions (MVP)

### Key Technical Decisions
- **Monolithic First**: Single codebase for faster development and deployment
- **REST + WebSockets**: Simple, proven communication patterns
- **Single Database**: PostgreSQL with proper indexing for MVP scale
- **Container Deployment**: Docker Compose for simple deployment
- **Basic UI**: React with minimal components for core functionality

### Technology Stack (Simplified)
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express (single application)
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (primary), Redis (sessions/caching)
- **Deployment**: Docker + Docker Compose
- **Authentication**: JWT + bcrypt
- **Real-time**: Socket.io for WebSocket connections

## Implementation Strategy (MVP)

### Development Phases
1. **Phase 1: Core Backend (2-3 weeks)**
   - Basic agent management APIs
   - Simple task orchestration engine
   - REST API structure
   - Database schema design

2. **Phase 2: Frontend Dashboard (2-3 weeks)**
   - Agent monitoring interface
   - Task management UI
   - Basic real-time updates
   - User authentication flow

3. **Phase 3: AI Integration & Refinement (1-2 weeks)**
   - OpenAI GPT-4 integration
   - Basic agent communication protocols
   - Performance optimization
   - Bug fixes and polish

**Total MVP Timeline**: 6-8 weeks

### Team Requirements (MVP)
- **Backend Developer**: 1 person
- **Frontend Developer**: 1 person
- **Part-time DevOps**: 1 person
- **Total Budget**: ~$100,000 (vs $500,000 for full version)

## Success Criteria (MVP)

### MVP Success Metrics
- Support for 10-50 concurrent agents (not 10,000)
- Task completion within acceptable timeframes
- Basic user satisfaction with core functionality
- Proven technical feasibility of agent coordination

### Technical Benchmarks (MVP)
- Task initiation: <1 second (relaxed from 500ms)
- Agent communication: <500ms (relaxed from 100ms)
- 99% uptime (basic hosting)
- Responsive web interface

### Quality Gates (MVP)
- Core functionality working without critical bugs
- Basic security implemented (authentication, input validation)
- Basic tests for critical paths
- Simple documentation for deployment and usage

## Task Breakdown Preview (MVP)

- [ ] **Core Backend**: Agent management, task orchestration, API endpoints
- [ ] **Database Setup**: Schema design, migrations, basic queries
- [ ] **Frontend Dashboard**: Agent monitoring, task management interface
- [ ] **AI Integration**: Single LLM provider integration, agent communication
- [ ] **Deployment & Testing**: Docker setup, basic testing, documentation

## Dependencies (MVP)

### External Dependencies (Minimal)
- **AI Provider**: OpenAI API access (GPT-4)
- **Hosting**: Basic cloud server (AWS EC2, DigitalOcean, etc.)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL hosting

### Internal Dependencies
- **Small Team**: 2-3 developers total
- **Simple Infrastructure**: Basic deployment knowledge
- **Basic Design**: Minimal UI/UX requirements

### Prerequisites
- OpenAI API key
- Basic cloud hosting account
- Development environment setup

## Estimated Effort (MVP)

### Timeline Estimate
- **Total Duration**: 6-8 weeks
- **Phase 1**: 2-3 weeks (Backend)
- **Phase 2**: 2-3 weeks (Frontend)
- **Phase 3**: 1-2 weeks (Integration & Polish)

### Resource Requirements
- **Development Team**: 2 developers + part-time DevOps
- **Total Budget**: ~$100,000
- **Infrastructure Costs**: ~$500/month (basic hosting)

### Critical Path Items
- AI integration and testing
- Basic agent communication protocols
- Core task orchestration logic
- Simple but functional user interface

## Tasks Created (MVP)
- [ ] 001.md - Core Backend and APIs (MVP)
- [ ] 002.md - Database Schema and Setup (MVP)
- [ ] 003.md - Frontend Dashboard (MVP)
- [ ] 004.md - AI Integration (MVP)
- [ ] 005.md - Deployment and Documentation (MVP)

**Task Summary (MVP):**
- Total tasks: 5 (vs 8 in full version)
- All tasks can be partially parallel
- Estimated total effort: ~320 hours (vs 732 hours)
- Focus on delivering core value quickly

## Next Steps After MVP

Once MVP is validated, consider:
- Performance optimization and scaling
- Additional AI provider integrations
- Advanced workflow features
- Enterprise requirements (security, monitoring, etc.)
- Production-scale deployment
