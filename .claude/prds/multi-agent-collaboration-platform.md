# PRD: Multi-Agent Collaboration Platform

## Executive Summary

The Multi-Agent Collaboration Platform is designed to enable seamless coordination and cooperation between multiple AI agents and human users to tackle complex problems that exceed the capabilities of individual agents. The platform will provide intelligent task decomposition, agent-to-agent communication, human oversight mechanisms, and conflict resolution systems to create a collaborative ecosystem where different specialized agents can work together effectively.

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges
- **Complex Task Management**: Single AI agents struggle with complex, multi-faceted tasks requiring diverse expertise
